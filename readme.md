#### Interactive Stories using [lichen](https://github.com/viperscape/lichen)

[inter.stratisgame.com: interactive stories](http://inter.stratisgame.com)

##### Contributions

If you would like to add a story, fork this repo and create a PR with a new lichen sourced story (inside [/stories](/stories)). The interstratis server is automatically rebuilt with new stories when the PR merges.

##### Interface

The story interface is currently being built up using a mix of lichen sourced web templates, and a basic rust http backend. The client view is under construction and as such not all lichen syntax options are being utilized. Please see [tracked issues](https://github.com/viperscape/interstratis/issues). Feel free to submit issues, PR's, input.
